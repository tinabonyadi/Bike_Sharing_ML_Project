# Bike_Sharing_ML_Project
Abstract:
My project centered around the analysis of a bike-sharing dataset, comprising 17,379 rows and 17 columns. Employing a regression methodology facilitated by PyCaret and various libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, I initiated the project by downloading and uploading the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook. Following a comprehensive analysis, I selectively removed certain columns, including 'instant,' 'casual,' 'registered,' 'atemp,' and 'dteday.' To gain insights into the relationships between various features and the target column ('cnt'), I utilized diverse visualization techniques. The preprocessing phase involved applying the One Hot encoding method to enhance the model's interpretability. Subsequently, I partitioned the dataset into training and testing sets, allocating 80% and 20%, respectively. Navigating through multiple stages, I identified the optimal model, CatBoost, which exhibited an R^2 value of approximately 0.9, signifying its exceptional performance for the given dataset.
